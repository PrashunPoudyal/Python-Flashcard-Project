How to Run Program (for users):
If this is the first time opening the program, run it for the first time *INSIDE AN INDIVIDUAL FOLDER WITH NO OTHER CONTENTS*
The program will create 2 folders
1. Config folder
2. Programs folder

both are necessary for the program to function. Do not change anything within this folders, or the folder itself, unless you know what you are doing.

any file within the program file (except for gen.dat) can be removed or transferred at will, as it is the actual flashcard information, however removal
of that particular file will result in the information of that particular flashcard to be lost.

Any file within the config folder cannot be touched or else the entire config folder will go back into default settings.

Project Description:
I created this project to help me remember things in other classes as well as a project for CS20. The application allows you to build your own flashcards
and use them to test yourself. This application also allows you to send flashcards to your friends, which means you can all share flashcards
to better your studying habits.

Although the UI is not that great, the overall program is very simple and easy to use. In the future I would like to add a feature where I can add flashcards
to existing projects, as right now you have to create a brand new flashcard set even if you just want to add one more flashcard.

Documentation for Folders and Code:

Folders:
Config folder contains all the configuration settings for the program.

Programs folder contains all the programs for the program.
gen.dat is inside the Programs folder and is the representation for "New Program". gen.dat meaning "generateNew.dat", as in
selecting this within the menu option will tell the program that you want to make a new program.
If this file is deleted, the program will still be able to run, however it might not have the "New Program" selection the first time you run it.
